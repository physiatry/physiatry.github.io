## Featured in a College Application personal essay
> [..]
  After over a year of living in constant pain, I met a physiatrist, Dr. Shoval, who changed my life. She immediately diagnosed what was causing my pain. She took me off all my medications and started me on a very specialized physical therapy regime. Slowly, I got better. I am now able to do everything I did before my knee injury- ski, swim, hike, and most importantly, live my life without constant pain. I know that I was not able to perform as well as I could have academically in my first two years of high school, had this not happened to me. However, I truly feel that this happened for me versus to me because I now know the real value of my health over all else.

## What colleagues say about Dr. Shoval

> ... which is wonderful because Dr. Aura Shoval is oiur physiatrist there.  Dr. Shoval is one of the most amazing, bright, thorough, and compassionate physicians I know.  I would highly recommend that your friend's child see Dr. Shoval.

> Thank you again so much Dr. Shoval!  I wanted to tell you specifically that I always really appreciate your lectures because 
  you are able to get people to participate! There was more participation during your lecture yesterday than I think any other virtual lecture we have had since Covid started and I think it makes it a much more enjoyable experience for everyone. So thank you! "thank you so much! Especially for doing it in the middle of your conference. We really enjoyed the lecture yesterday!

> Thank you again for taking the time out of your schedule to lecture on Wednesday!  The the lecture interactive and engaging. 
  I know this is not easy to do, especially on a teleconferencing platform. In addition to the content, you brought so much energy to the presentation. Please let me know if there are any other topics you are interested in lecturing on in the future. I will make a note of it.

### Therapists

> I just wanted to touch base as I saw X the first time since receiving his botox injections. I am so impressed with his range and alignment. His gait training is improving drastically with the rifton walker with the decrease in tone and spasticity.

> I was super impressed with X when I saw her last week. Improved sitting balance on 6" box, her hands and arms are more relaxed and she holds her weight through her arms better in quadruped, i can guide her through quadruped to squat to stand opening the hips up into abduction and external rotation....less scissoring and flatter feet in standing. Does not seem to be sore in the legs (and as might be expected no skin reaction at injection sites). Really nice. Thanks!

> Thanks for getting back in touch with me Aura. :-)  Really, you are quite a few bars higher than most physicians with regards to keeping  correspondence. It is most appreciated by me, and I think more importantly by the families, who have such high praises for you! 
> I'd love your insights on BTX, baclofen, ETOH, SDR and anything else to manage spasticity and NM impairments


> HI Dr. Shoval: 
> First I wanted to say thank you x1000. X received her equipment. If it wasn't for you she never would have received it.  I only had a chance to see her in the hi lo chair which is well fitted and she is at this point tolerating well. 
> Thank you Dr. Shoval!
> What a great conversation and team work going on here, I love it!
> Miss her much. Glad she has a great team between you all!
> I'm very happy that they are coming to see you.  Kindly let me know your thoughts.  
> Warm Regards,

## Some quotes from around the world

> I was looking into appropriate management and i came to one of your article in Americal journal of physical medicine and 
  rehabilitation where you have presented case series of succesful delivery of botox in SMA patients. I went into your resume and discover that you are an expertise in this field of botox administration. I wanted to have a second opinion about botox from you as you yourself is experienced in this field...I know i am writing a lot but as a father of a SMA child and a curious doctor myself, i would be grateful if you could share your experiences. This would be really helpful in planning for botox...

> Thank you so much for your prompt response. It was definitely helpful and will surely add a lot before 
  i finally decide for botox here in poland.
