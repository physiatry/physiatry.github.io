## Featured in a College Application personal essay
> [..]
  After over a year of living in constant pain, I met a physiatrist, Dr. Shoval, who changed my life. She immediately diagnosed what was causing my pain. She took me off all my medications and started me on a very specialized physical therapy regime. Slowly, I got better. I am now able to do everything I did before my knee injury- ski, swim, hike, and most importantly, live my life without constant pain. I know that I was not able to perform as well as I could have academically in my first two years of high school, had this not happened to me. However, I truly feel that this happened for me versus to me because I now know the real value of my health over all else.

> Thank you again so much Dr. Shoval!  I wanted to tell you specifically that I always really appreciate your lectures because 
  you are able to get people to participate! There was more participation during your lecture yesterday than I think any other virtual lecture we have had since Covid started and I think it makes it a much more enjoyable experience for everyone. So thank you! "thank you so much! Especially for doing it in the middle of your conference. We really enjoyed the lecture yesterday!

> Thank you again for taking the time out of your schedule to lecture on Wednesday!  The the lecture interactive and engaging. 
  I know this is not easy to do, especially on a teleconferencing platform. In addition to the content, you brought so much energy to the presentation. Please let me know if there are any other topics you are interested in lecturing on in the future. I will make a note of it.

## Some quotes from around the world

> I was looking into appropriate management and i came to one of your article in Americal journal of physical medicine and 
  rehabilitation where you have presented case series of succesful delivery of botox in SMA patients. I went into your resume and discover that you are an expertise in this field of botox administration. I wanted to have a second opinion about botox from you as you yourself is experienced in this field...I know i am writing a lot but as a father of a SMA child and a curious doctor myself, i would be grateful if you could share your experiences. This would be really helpful in planning for botox...

> Thank you so much for your prompt response. It was definitely helpful and will surely add a lot before 
  i finally decide for botox here in poland.
