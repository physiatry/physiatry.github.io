on pediatric physiatrists.

Selected quotes:

> However, the field of physiatry is "very different than pretty much every other specialty," said Dr. Aura Shoval, a pediatric rehabilitation physician at Children's Specialized Hospital. "It's very holistic. Instead of specializing in one body part, physiatrists specialized in function and quality of life. We're really focused on the patient and what it is that they want to achieve."

> "Our main objectives are to restore or improve function, like walking, and maximize quality of life, like decrease pain," said Dr. Shoval. "We want to provide the best care possible for every child so that they're able to reach their full potential."

> Dr. Shoval and her team also prioritize prevention – recognizing potential side effects and complications from varying conditions, and helping patients prevent or mitigate any potential long-term damage. For example, children with brain injury are at risk for depression, brain bleeds, and joint contractures to name a few. “We know what things patients are at risk for,” she said. “We know how to catch them early, treat them, and in some cases prevent them entirely.”

> In general, pediatric physiatry is “focused on development” she explained — in large part because the pediatrics field itself involves patients who are at crucial stages of growth.

> "Kids are developing physically, emotionally, psychologically just in so many different ways," she said. "We really have a chance to impact the child for the rest of their life." This goes well beyond the physical and medical. Physiatrists not only improve physical capabilities, but in doing so also change the way kids and teens view their own capabilities. “I want children to see functional improvements before the message from society of ‘you can’t do that’ becomes engrained. We can really shape them into [someone that says], ‘I can.’”

> “We have this huge breadth of coordinated services,” Dr. Shoval said. As an example, she shared what might happen if a physiatrist encounters a child who has trouble swallowing. A feeding therapist can help teach the child to sense food in the mouth and to practice the mechanics of chewing and swallowing. A psychologist might get involved to help with food aversions. An occupational therapist can help the child with postural strengthening and awareness needed to sit up at the table, as well as the coordination to use utensils. While a nutritionist will make sure that the patient is getting enough nutrients.

> Tying everything together is a physiatrist, who Dr. Shoval said is “trying to look at the whole picture and diagnosing the underlying medical causes to the swallowing difficulty while ensuring all contributing causes are being treated.”

> “When they do reach us, we diagnose and treat their conditions with medication, injections, bracing, therapy and recommend specific orthopedic or neurosurgical procedures if needed,” Dr. Shoval said. “It’s really nice for me to see the delight in patients or families faces when they say, ‘Oh my gosh – this is the type of doctor I’ve been searching for. Why didn’t anyone tell me about this specialty sooner?’ We love treating our patients and seeing their results as they start walking, running, feeding themselves and excelling in school.”
