The Stevens Pre-Health Medical Honor Society Alpha Epsilon Delta (AED)
and StevensTHON together invited Dr. Shoval to present to aspiring
pre-medical students.

An important focus was to educate and inspire students in the
importance and scope of work in rehabilitation medicine.
As joked during the presentation:
> If I can convince even one of you to enter physiatry today, Iâ€™ve done my job.

The event was advertised on the honor society's [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpermalink.php%3Fstory_fbid%3Dpfbid0NeRsWj3Q3TwTfLnc1sU4KR5uEfnpmzegX8mRq8Cr6kWbAVemPGMX8tYvgqGudNR2l%26id%3D1615303035455476&show_text=true&width=500).

[An article](https://thestute.com/2018/03/02/aed-and-stevensthon-invite-csh-pediatric-physiatrist-aura-shoval/)
in the independent student newspaper of Stevens Institute of Technology (The Stute) appeared a few days later.

Seth Kirschner, StevensTHON Corporate Sponsorship Chair, commented that

> Dr. Shoval provided us with a perspective from the hospital that we do not normally hear about.<br/>
> Not only was it an incredible learning experience, but her words of wisdom to incoming medical students were invaluable.
