Dr. Shoval succesfully pitched the idea for a [Golf Digest article](https://www.golfdigest.com/story/how-an-unfathomable-tragedy-prompted-golf-community-come-together-timothy-piazza-memorial-foundation) about the Timothy J. Piazza Memorial Foundation and their gold fundraiser.

The Golf Digest article notes that Dr. Shoval was [an invited Speaker in 2023](/blog/presentations/2023-08-07-piazza/), and quotes her observation that

> A lot of insurances will only replace the prosthetics once a year," Shoval said. "Well, kids grow every second. You know what I mean? You blink an eye and the kid is like a foot taller. So sometimes, you can't wait a year, you need a new one or you need one for running or one for an instrument. And then, in that case, we submit it to the foundation. And then they review them and they have been very generous in approving the prosthesis.
