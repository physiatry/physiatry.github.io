In partnership with [Achilles
International](https://www.achillesinternational.org/) and the
[IamMore Foundation](https://iammorefoundation.org/),
[NewYork-Presbyterian Rehabilitation
Medicine](https://www.nyp.org/rehabmed) organized an Olympic Field
Day.

Situated with various sports stations and craft activities, this event
enabled NYP's disabled pediatric population to participate in sporting
events and showcase their talents.
