Dr. Shoval volunteered as the Accessible Dance Director with [Seeds Arts LLC](https://www.facebook.com/Igrowwithseeds/).

Her mission: "to create a program that is accessible for all dancers no
 matter what their physical needs may be. This will be a program for
 students with limited mobility where they can move what they can, as
 well as making our other classes accessible for all no matter their
 ability or financial situation."
