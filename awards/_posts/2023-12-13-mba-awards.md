On the last day of Negotations Class (an MBA class at [Rutgers
Business School](https://www.business.rutgers.edu/), we had fun with
the class voting for the "Most ___" awards. I received the "Most
Creative" (i.e. "best at developing unique and integrative solutions")
One of my favorite parts of this class was finding creative solutions
so that both parties maximized their benefit. I truly enjoyed
"expanding the pie."

Surprisingly, I also received " Best Acting in a Negotiation" ("did
the best job getting into character for a negotiation".) I laughed out
loud when I was asked if I had acting experience. On further
reflection, to find a beneficial solution for both parties, I had to
"get into my role" and be able to see things from the other person's
perspective.
