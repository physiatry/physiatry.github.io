Voting time!  Dr Shoval presented two equally impactful proposals to help children with disabilities and members voted. The winning proposal?  "Let's Move NJ!"  üèÜ 

As someone who provides medical treatment to these children and advocates for them and their families daily, Dr Shoval knows how life-changing this will be!

This will provide children and their families needed access and equipment for movement, recreation, and adaptive sports. Adaptive sports are known to have so many benefits, not just medically but socially and psychologically. Sports can also provide children with the needed skills to succeed in college and in the job market. 

Thank you to the members who have all donated 1K towards this cause! If you are looking to donate to somewhere where 100% will go directly to help children, look into Lil‚Äô Heroes for Hope! 

Thank you to [Reem Sara Batarseh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reem-sara-batarseh-a82a3217a/) for organizing and to the [SPRING LAKE HOPE FOUNDATION INC](https://www.springlakehopefoundation.org/) and their inspiring President & CEO, [Paulette Pera Laurenzi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulette-pera-laurenzi-82923517/).
