Committee](https://www.aacpdm.org/about-us/committees/adapted-sports-recreation),
part of the [American Academy for Cerebral Palsy & Developmental
Medicine (AACPDM)](https://www.aacpdm.org/).

During the general session, I presented the [Duncan Wyeth
Award](https://www.aacpdm.org/professional-opportunities/awards) to
Clayton Frech, recognizing that he "demonstrates outstanding
participation in or promotion of sports and recreation and serves as a
role model for people with disabilities."
