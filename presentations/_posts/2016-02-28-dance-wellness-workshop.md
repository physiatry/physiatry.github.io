The [Weill Cornell Center for the Performing
Artist](https://weillcornell.org/services/center-for-the-performing-artist)
hosted a [Dancer Wellness
Workshop](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10103413458468714&id=5309607)
at the [Battery Dance Company](https://batterydance.org/) studio in
Tribeca.  This was an informal educational lecture discussing
nutrition and performance optimization for dancers.

I was invited to speak about the [female athlete
triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_energy_deficiency_in_sport).
Along with the other presenters, I also demonstrated proper taping
technique for common dancing injuries.
