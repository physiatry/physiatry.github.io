Mentorship has been demonstrated to be the most effective tool for
things like diversity equity and inclusion, as well as for success in
the workplace. Dr Shoval believes that mentoring and teaching has one of the
highest return on investment (ROI's) and often ripples far beyond the
impact that you can see.

It was an absolute honor to serve on the mentorship committee as a
part of the [American College of Healthcare Executives of New Jersey
(ACHE-NJ)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/achenj/). Dr Shoval was
particularly fortunate to have the opportunity to mentor [Jasmine
Hicks, MPH, CPXP,
FACHE](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasminehicksmph/), a healthcare
leader who leads her team by example, and dedicates her time and
expertise to her community in so many ways.

At this holiday party, the committee had the opportunity to celebrate
all of the mentor-mentee pairs, and Dr Shoval was honored to have the
opportunity to speak about mentorship as well as hand out the
certificates to all of the participants.
