Hey everyone! I’m currently a third year medical student at Rutgers
NJMS and went to UC Berkeley for undergrad, where I majored in
microbiology. When I’m not doing research, I enjoy playing basketball
and obsessing over my fantasy football team! Fun fact about myself: I
played 3 instruments when I was younger.
